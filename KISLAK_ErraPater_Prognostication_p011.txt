A Prognostication for ever,
made by ERRA PATER.

As I find in the Science of Astronomy, there be four manner of Cholers in Manâ€™s Body, of the four Complexions. The first is Blood; the second, black Choler; the third Flumes; the fourth yellow Choler: And if one of the four lack, all the Body will be forthwith dead: for as much sustaineth one of them the Body as the other.

And each of them ought to be at a certain, for if one of them surmount the other, all the body shall have damage thereby, and all four be perilous: for if the blood surmount the other, it will soon destroy and overcome the body, and make him die: for it gathereth, and likewise congealeth even right on the heart and the breath: and in that manner lessening by little and little, is overcome and dead; but all that time, when the great course taketh him, it may soon be asswaged by taking away a little blood from him, for then all the peril will asswage.

Also the black Cholers be right perilous, and if they surmount the other, they do great damage
