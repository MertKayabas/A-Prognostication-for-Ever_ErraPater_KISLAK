of Erra Pater.

any men or women be let blood of wound or vein they shall die within one and twenty days following. And who so falleth into sickness on any of these days, they shall never escape it till they be dead. And who so taketh any great journey in any of these days to go from home, he shall be in danger to die ere he comes home again. And whoso weddeth a wife in any of these days they shall soon be parted, or else they live together with much sorrow. And whoso beginneth in any of these days any great work, it shall never come to good end: and those are the days following.

That is to say.

In January are eight days, that is to say, the first, the second, the fourth, the fifth, the tenth, the fifteenth, the seventeenth, and the nineteenth.
In February are three days, the eighth, the ninth, and the seventeenth.
In March are three days, the fifteenth, the sixteenth, and the one and twentieth.
In April are two days, the fifteenth and the one and twentieth.
In May are three days, the seventh, the fifteenth, and the twentieth.
In June are two days, the fourth and the seventh.
In July are two days, the fifteenth and the twentieth.
