In the month of October, drink good and wholesome wine, and bleed not except great need make thee, but look that the Sign be very good, and yet beware that thou bleed not on the third day, nor on the sixth day, nor on the fourteenth day, and thou wilt doe well.

December.

In the month of December bleed not but if thou have great need for thy health. And in case thou hast much need to bleed, beware of the fifth day, the seventh day, the fifteenth day
