The Prognostication

mage to the Body, by many and divers means: for they cause the body to fail, by the Evil-sickness, and to lose his wit and knowledge, and become a Fool; and they cause all the body to be full of evil scabs, and oft times to be measel’d; and they make a Man to be fearful and a coward, of many ill manners. And by herbs, flowers, fasting, abstinence, drink and medicines they may be asswaged.

The Flumes that be white be right perillous also, when they surmount the other Cholers of the Body, they do great damage and hurt; for they engender Gouts, and many other evil sicknesses that be cold; and they also hurt the feet, the legs, the knees, the hands, the reins, and the teeth, and make the mouth and breath stinking, and the nose and the ears; and causeth many other diseases and sicknesses. And they may be asswaged by herbs, flowers, roots, medicines, drinks, and by vomiting.

Also the yellow Cholers be perillous: for when they surmount the other Cholers in a man’s body, they affoyant the heart, and trouble the brain, and make all the members feeble and soft, and take away the will and appetite from the body, that it may neither eat nor drink; and also they change a man’s colour, and make him to lose his sight and become blind. And they may be asswaged by herbs, flowers, roots, and by vomiting.

The four Humours be of four complexions, and they have the domination of the body four times in the year.
