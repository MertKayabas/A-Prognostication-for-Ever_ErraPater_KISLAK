The disposition of the xii Months for Blood-letting.

January.

In the month of January, let thee not blood on the first day, for it is perilous, nor the second day, nor the fifth day, nor tenth day, nor the fifteenth day, nor the nineteenth day, nor the twentieth day, nor the twenty fifth day; but as often as thou wilt drink good white wine fasting; and also take good heed of the days that be above written, for they be perilous to bleed on, except the sign be right good for blood-letting.

February.

In the month of February, eat no potage made of docks and mallows, for they are venomous: And if thou hast need to bleed on thy wrist, or on thy arm, bleed not the fourth day, nor the fifth day, nor on the eighth day, nor on the fifteenth day, nor on the eighteenth day, but that the sign be very good, and thou have great need.
