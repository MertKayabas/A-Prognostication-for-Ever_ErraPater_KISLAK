of Erra Pater.

The Air, the Water, and the Earth: the Fire is hot and dry; his Element is likened unto the Ram, the Lion, and the Shooter; for these be hot and dry. Also the Air is hot and moist; his Element is likened unto the Children, the Balance and the Water-bearer; for they be hot and moist. The Water is cold and moist; and the Water is likened to the Crab, the Scorpion, and the Fish. The Earth is dry and cold; so the Earth is likened the Bull, the Man, and the Goat; for they be dry and cold.

And every one of these Signs is divided into thirty even parts; these parts are called degrees, and every degree is divided into sixty even parts, and these parts are called minutes; and every minute is divided into sixty even parts, and these parts be called seconds; and so forth to the thirds and fourths.

It is also to be understood, that there are seven Planets, as Saturnus, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and Luna. These be the seven moveable Stars. The aforesaid twelve Signs take great power and might of the seven Planets; and the seven Planets take great power of the twelve Signs; for the Planets be to the Signs, as the Soul to the Body; and the Signs to the Planets, as the Body to the Soul. For like as the Body can do nothing without the Soul, nor the Soul do anything without the Body; no more may a Sign without one of the seven Planets.
