For this project on “A Prognostication for Ever” and the collection of metadata, I only selected the file name, unique identifier, page number, iiif canvas id, image width and height, and file size as the meta data to record. This captures the essential information that is needed to locate the digital images of the pages and some other details. I focused on what was most reliable and relevant for archival purposes that was easily identifiable within the Visual Data Coder. To avoid recording potentially inaccurate or misleading information, I stuck to what was accessible in teh Visual Data Coder. This metadata gives a foundation to build off of when studying or referencing this given book and anyone who views the data set can trace the origins of a page through the IIIF and look at specific information like size of the file and dimensions of the images. There are pretty interesting differences in the size and dimensions between the first couple pages and the rest of the pages that I selected.
