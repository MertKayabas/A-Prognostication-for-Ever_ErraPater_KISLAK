The Prognostication

March.

In the month of March, eat Figs, Raisins, and sweet meats and drinks, and eat hot meats,
and let the blood on thy right arm on the fifth day, or on the twelfth day, or on the seventeenth
day; for it is good against all manner of Fevers; but beware thou bleed not the first day, nor the
fifteenth day, nor the sixteenth day, nor the nineteenth day, nor the eight and twentieth day, if
thou mayest chuse; and if thou do, look the Sign be very good.

April.

In the month of April, bleed on the left arm on the third day, or on the eleventh day, or on
the fifteenth day, and thou shalt have no great head-ach, nor lose thy sight of all that year;
and use fresh and hot meat; but bleed not the seventeenth day, nor the eighth day, nor the tenth day,
nor the twentieth day; for these days be not good for bleeding.

May.

In the month of May, rise early, and eat and drink betimes, and use good meats and drinks;
but eat neither of head nor feet while thou fastest; and let the blood on the first, or on the
eighteenth day on which arm thou wilt, or on the twenty seventh day, or on the twenty
eighth day, and it shall help thee against all manner
