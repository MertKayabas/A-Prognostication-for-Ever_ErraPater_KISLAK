June.

In the month of June, some Physicians say, that it is good every day to drink a quantity of coole water fasting, and rule thee of thy meat and drink; and if thou have need, bleed on the twenty eighth day, for that is good: but beware that thou bleed not on the seventh day, nor on the tenth day, nor on the fifteenth day, nor on the sixteenth day, nor the twentieth day.

July.

In the month of July, keep thee from Lechery; for then the Brain and Humours are always open: and bleed not in this month, but if thou have great need; and then beware always that thou bleed not on the thirteenth day, nor on the fifteenth day, for it is dangerous.

August.

In the month of August, eat no manner of worts, nor any manner of hot meats and drinks of spicery: nor bleed on the first day, nor the twentieth day, nor the twenty ninth day, nor the thirtieth day; the other days thou mayest bleed for great need if the Sign be good for blood-letting; but not else, if thou love to keep thy body in good health.
